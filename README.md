# WGAN-MNIST
Train a WGAN model with MNIST data set to generate handwritten digits

'wgan_generated_digits_display.py' is a program which displays handwritten digits generated by WGAN model and compares them with samples from MNIST training data set.

'wgan_mnist_rev2.py' is the program which builds & trains the WGAN model using MNIST training data set. If 'restore' set to True, then we resume training the model from previously saved checkpoint ; If 'restore' set to False, then we start trainig the model for the first time.
